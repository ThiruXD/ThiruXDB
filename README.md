## Features

- **Endpoint Manager** — Add, edit, activate/deactivate, and delete API endpoints with support for `None`, `Bearer`, `API Key`, and `Basic` authentication
- **Dynamic Path Variables** — Automatically orchestrate mass API fetching by injecting variables (like `{id}`) into URLs from another MongoDB collection's fields.
- **Custom Collections** — Store fetched data in a central `data_records` collection or automatically route it to dedicated custom collections.
- **Field Mappings** — Map and transform response fields (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`) to a unified schema
- **One-click Fetch** — Pull data from a single endpoint or all active endpoints at once, with robust background fault tolerance and error skipping.
- **Cancellable & Resumable Sync** — Safely cancel active data syncs without corrupting data. Progress states (like `partial`) are stored persistently and seamlessly resume on refresh.
- **Ultra-Fast Database Insertion** — Automatically batches operations into memory and leverages MongoDB's `bulkWrite` API to insert thousands of records simultaneously at absolute maximum wire speed.
- **Data Browser** — Paginated table/grid view with date range filters, endpoint filtering, and full-text search.
- **Fetch Logs** — Complete history of every fetch operation with status, record counts, duration, and errors. Includes granular deletion and "Clear All" features to manage history.
- **Live Terminal Logs** — Real-time, streaming terminal view of your background Sync Engine operations, just like deployment logs, with auto-scrolling and log size monitoring.
- **High-Performance Dashboard** — Live stats cached directly on endpoint documents for instantaneous rendering of total records, active endpoints, and distributions.
- **Export** — Download current view as JSON or CSV
- **Mobile Responsive** — Fully optimized UI with sidebar overlays and responsive grids for managing data on the go.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — Three-tier permission system (`admin`, `editor`, `viewer`) utilizing bcrypt password hashing. Includes granular, per-user page restrictions (e.g., blocking access to Endpoints, Fetch Data, Data Browser, or Fetch Logs).
- **Zero-Config Dynamic JWT Manager** — The backend utilizes the `jose` library to automatically generate a secure cryptographic secret, export it as a JWK (JSON Web Key), and persist it securely in MongoDB. No need to manage or configure a `JWT_SECRET` environment variable!
- **Dynamic Session Timeout** — Admins can change the global session expiration time directly from the "System Security" panel in the UI (e.g., `30m` for 30 minutes, `12h` for 12 hours, `7d` for 7 days).
- **Session Hijacking Prevention** — JWT tokens are cryptographically fingerprinted using a hash of the user's IP Address and Browser User-Agent. Stolen or forged session tokens will instantly be invalidated if used on a different device or network.
- **Anti-Export & Screenshot Security** — If a user is restricted from exporting, the UI activates robust deterrence: text selection and right-clicking are disabled, Developer Tools are trapped, keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, F12, Snipping Tool) are blocked, and the screen aggressively blurs to 0% opacity if the window loses focus to deter screen recording software.
- **Public REST API Gateway** — Generate secure API keys to expose aggregated data to external applications via `/api/v1/public/:collection`. Includes dynamic filtering, pagination, MongoDB query translation, and highly granular rate limiting (per second/minute/hour) and usage quotas (per day/week/month).
- **Activity & IP Auditing** — Comprehensive user activity logs with automatic IP Geolocation (`ip-api.com`), tracking ISPs, Cities, and Device information. All API requests to third-party IP services are strictly proxied through the Node.js backend to bypass aggressive browser CORS and CSP restrictions.
- **Frappe UI "Espresso" Aesthetic** — Sleek, flat design layout natively built in React + Tailwind.
- **Global Light/Dark Mode** — Fully responsive theme switching that persists in local storage.
- **Local Auth & Root Admin Protection** — Simple session-based login (no external auth service required). The primary Admin account's credentials are strictly enforced via the `.env` file, meaning the root password bypasses the database and cannot be tampered with or locked out via the UI.

## Why Use ThiruXDB? (Use Cases)

ThiruXDB is designed to solve a very specific problem: **Consolidating scattered data from dozens of different REST APIs into a single, highly searchable MongoDB database without writing custom scripts for every integration.**

### Who is this for?
- **Data Analysts & Scientists:** Who need to pull massive amounts of data from third-party APIs (like weather data, financial stocks, or sports statistics) into a database for analysis, without needing to write Node.js or Python scraper scripts.
- **Backend Developers:** Who are migrating legacy systems or aggregating data from microservices and need a reliable, fault-tolerant background engine to sync the data without building custom ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines from scratch.
- **OSINT Researchers:** Who need to continuously poll public APIs, handle rate limits, and map varying JSON structures into a unified format for investigation.
- **Agencies & Freelancers:** Who want to hand off a beautiful, permission-controlled, white-labeled dashboard to clients so they can browse aggregated data and export it to CSV.

### Why should you use it?
1. **No More One-Off Scripts:** Stop writing brittle `fetch()` loops in Python or Node.js every time you need to pull data from a new API. Just paste the URL into ThiruXDB, map the fields, and click fetch.
2. **Built-in Fault Tolerance:** Writing a script to download 10,000 items is hard because networks fail. ThiruXDB automatically handles connection drops, skips malformed data, and lets you safely pause/resume massive sync operations.
3. **Instant Admin Panel:** Getting data into a database is only half the battle. ThiruXDB instantly gives you and your team a lightning-fast, searchable frontend to actually *look* at the data you just downloaded.
4. **Public REST API Gateway:** Turn ThiruXDB into your organization's central Data Hub. Securely distribute aggregated data to your external apps or third-party clients via API Keys and `GET /api/v1/public/...` endpoints, complete with built-in pagination, filtering, and API Rate Limits to prevent abuse.
5. **Military-Grade Security:** With built-in RBAC, JWT fingerprinting, dynamic cryptographic keys, and anti-export protections, you can safely give external clients or junior employees access to view the data without worrying about them deleting it, stealing it, or hijacking sessions.

## Sync Engine Architecture & Deployment

ThiruXDB uses a highly optimized, state-persistent Sync Engine designed to handle massive data payloads. Because this engine relies on long-running background tasks and persistent database connections, **your choice of hosting platform is critical.**

### ❌ Serverless Platforms (Not Recommended)
Serverless platforms instantly "freeze" or kill execution environments as soon as an HTTP request finishes or times out (usually 10 seconds). Because ThiruXDB runs background data pipelines that can take several minutes to process thousands of records, **Serverless platforms will freeze the background job and sever database connections if you close your browser.**

- **Netlify & Vercel:** You can deploy here, but **you must keep your browser tab open** while syncing so the UI's 1-second polling keeps the serverless function awake. If you close the tab, the sync will instantly freeze and fail.
- **Cloudflare Pages / Workers (Not Supported):** The Express backend uses the native `mongodb` Node.js driver, which requires raw TCP socket access (`net` and `tls` modules). Cloudflare's V8 Isolates do not support these modules, meaning the backend will instantly crash.

### ✅ Persistent Servers (Highly Recommended)
To run infinite background syncs, you must deploy to a **Persistent Server** that runs 24/7. This allows you to click "Fetch", close your laptop, and let the server securely process 10,000+ records in the background!

**Top Free Platforms:**
1. **[Render.com](https://render.com/) (Web Service)**
   - **Build Command:** `bun install && bun run build` (or `npm install && npm run build`)
   - **Start Command:** `bun run start` (or `npm run start`)
   - *Note: ThiruXDB includes a built-in Anti-Sleep mechanism specifically designed for Render's Free Tier! It will automatically self-ping every 14 minutes to prevent your backend from sleeping during long background syncs.*
2. **[Railway.app](https://railway.app/)**
   - Automatically detects `package.json` and runs the `start` script flawlessly.
3. **VPS / Docker (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, AWS EC2)**
   - Run via `pm2 start server/index.js` or deploy via Docker.

> [!TIP]
> Ensure you configure all Environment Variables (`MONGODB_URI`, `MONGODB_DB`, etc.) in your hosting provider's dashboard before deploying!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) `>= 1.0`
- A MongoDB instance — [MongoDB Atlas free tier](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) works great

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThiruXD/Endpoint-URL-Migration-To-MongoDB.git
cd Endpoint-URL-Migration-To-MongoDB
bun install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGODB_DB=thiruXDB
PORT=3001
VITE_ADMIN_USERNAME=your_username_here
VITE_ADMIN_PASS=your_password_here
```

> **Note:** Bun loads `.env` automatically — no `dotenv` package required.

### 3. Run in Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

This starts both servers concurrently:
- **Vite** (frontend) → `http://localhost:5173`
- **Express API** → `http://localhost:3001`

Vite proxies all `/api/*` requests to the Express server, so the frontend just calls `/api/...`.

### 4. Login

Default credentials (change in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Username | `your_username` |
| Password | `your_password` |
